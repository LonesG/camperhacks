- ## Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The main colours used in this project are Prussian Blue (#003049), Gold Drop (#f77f00) and Shamrock (#3fe491).
        - The blue color reflects the open sky, good weather and sunny days. The golden color, again represents the sun and warm weather that is much loved by campers. Finally, the aqua color represents the water in nature.
        -   I made this pallete on iColorpalette.com. When I played around with the website, I didn't like the second color, Torch Red as I found it wasn't very easy on the eyes.      
                                    ![Colour Scheme](assets/wireframes/pallete.png)
        
    -   #### Typography
        -   The Roboto Slab font is the main font used throughout the body of the website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Roboto Slab is a clean font used frequently. I have used Montserrat as the headings font. I used Google Fonts to compare and contrast a variety of font matches and I believe this pairing makes the website easy to use and accessible. 
    -   #### Imagery
        -   I have used a large striking image on the home page of the website. I wanted to capture the sense of adventure that camping enthusiasts enjoy. The imagery used throughout the website fits in nicely with the colour scheme and I believe there is a nice flow to the overall imagery on each page of the website.

   - #### Icons
        - I decided to use the Font Awesome icons. The icons that I chose fit in well with the overall theme of nature and exploring. The icons are styled in accordance with my website, with the same colors and fonts. 

  -  #### Wireframes

        - I made some very basic wireframes using Balsamiq at the beginning of the project. As a total beginner, I found Balsamiq very helpful. I didn't quite know what styling I wanted on my pages but I had a very clear picture about the content. I knew how many pages I wanted my website to have and had a clear image in my head.  Balsamiq allowed me to create a visual of my idea and gave me a goal to work towards.

## Features

-  ### Existing Features
    - #### Navigation Bar
        -The navigation bar is featured on all pages. The fully responsive navigation  bar links to Home, Camper Hacks, Gallery and Sign Up pages. This navigation bar is repeated on all pages to allow the user to navigate the site easily.
        -Having the navigation bar the same on each page allows the user to use the website fluidly without having to make use of the 'back' bar when navigating between pages.

        ![Navigation Bar Image](assets/wireframes/navbar.png)

    - #### The Landing Page
        - The landing page contains a hero image that entices the user to use the page. The contrast between the image with mountains and snowy peaks and the background colour is intended to grab the users attention.

        ![Hero Image](assets/wireframes/heroimage.png)

    - #### The Who We Are section
        - The who we are section introduces the user to the Camper Hacks community, it's founders and gives a brief introduction. It lets the user know what they will find on the page and how to acess information.

        - This section is sub divided into three specific headings; Clothing, Gear and Food. The user will find a wide variety of tips and tricks, presented through the medium of text, video, imagery and links to external websites.

        ![Thank You Image](assets/wireframes/thankyou.png)

 -  ### Features Left to Implement
    - #### 'Contact Us' page
        - I think  another feature that could allow for another positive user experience is the addition of another page for "Contact Us". Here the users can submit their own  camper hacks which can then be used to update the site regularly.

        2. Underneath the hero image, there is a brief introduction to "Camper Hacks", defining the purpose of the page and introducing the community aspect on offer to users also. 
        3. The user has the option then to scroll down to learn some tips and tricks, under the headings Clothes, Gear and Food.

    2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily be able to navigate throughout the site to find content.

        1. The site has been designed with ease in mind. The user can access all pages from the navigation bar. On each  page, the navigation bar remains the same, allowing the user to develop a familiarity with the layout. The pages on the navigation bar are clearly labelled so that the user knows exactly what information they will find upon clicking the link to open a new page. 
        2. On the Sign Up Page, after a form response is submitted, a "Thank You" page will load. This brings the user to another page welcoming them to the community. Again, this page is designed in the same way as the rest of the site, allowing the user to navigate away from the page and back to another section of their choice.

    1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to locate the relevant social media links to see what kind of community Camper Hacks is.

        1. The relevant social media links are clearly shown in the footer.

The user is informed that signing up will subscribe them to the Camper Hacks Newsletter, which will then be emailed to them. In the newsletter, they will find details of meet ups. 
        3. On the Sign Up page, there is a "Sign Me Up!" button directly under the form which can be easily found.

    1. As a Frequent User, I want to find out the winners of the monthly cooking competition.
        1. The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and can navigate to the food section to find the winner.
        The winning recipe is also emailed in the newsletter each month. This is stated in the Food section for users to see.
