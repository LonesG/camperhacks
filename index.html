            <div id="who-we-are"> We are a community of fun loving, camping enthusiasts with a passion to share our
                camping
                experiences with one another.

                Proudly established in Munster, Ireland, Camper Hacks was created in 2021 by a small group of camping
                enthusiast buddies with a view to broaden the camping community in Ireland.

                We share 'Camper Hacks' as the name suggests, are the proud producers of our comprehensive newsletter
                "Camper Hacks" and
                organise monthly meet-ups for like minded people who want to join our community.</div>

                <ul>
                    <li>Our top hack when camping is to pack light, breathable clothes that can easily be dried
                        overnight. We recommend brands like Quechua (Decathlon), Columbia and Musto for gear.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        A light-weight rain jacket will keep you dry without weighing you down. It rains a lot in
                        Ireland! You want water-proof materials, not water resistant if you're planning a long hike!
                    </li>
                    <li><i class="fas fa-hiking"></i></li>
                    <li>Ensure you have enough socks! (And then add in three extra pairs.) Keep a fresh pair for each
                        night
                        also.
                    </li>
                    <li><i class="fas fa-hiking"></i></li>
                    <li>Bring a fleece lined hat for the cold mornings. This can go under a peak cap to help block out
                        the sun.</li>
                    <li><i class="fas fa-hiking"></i></li>
                    <li>Ankle-height hiking boots will be your best friend. These support the ankle should you stumble
                        on a
                        rock or
                        twig alone the way.
                    </li>

                <ul>
                    <li>First up, wet hiking boots can ruin a great day's hiking. Not
                        alone can
                        this cause athletes foot, blisters and some stinky feet; it's also an all-round unpleasant
                        experience! Hack this
                        by removing your insoles at the end of the day and stuffing your wet shoes with dry, dirty
                        clothes.
                        Moisture will be drawn to the dry clothes and you'll have nice dry boots for tomorrow's
                        hike!
                    </li>
                    <li><i class="fas fa-hiking"></i></li>
                    <li>You know those pesky bread tags? The ones that keep your Brennans bread nice and fresh?
                        These
                        plastic guys make very handy, almost indestrucible clothes pegs. Use them to clip up your
                        clothing
                        to your clothes line and dry off your clothes.
                    </li>
                    <li><i class="fas fa-hiking"></i></li>
                    <li>Imagine the scene: you wake up on a cold, crispy Irish morning. You climb out of your
                        sleeping
                        bag
                        and step straight into a warm set of new clothes to start your days hiking. Sound heavenly?
                        Putting
                        the clothes you’re
                        planning to wear the next day into the bottom of your sleeping bag with you before you go to
                        bed
                        is
                        up there with
                        our favourite clothing hack.</li>
                    <li><i class="fas fa-hiking"></i></li>
                    <li>We’re fully committed to reducing waste and recycling where possible. Plastic bags are great
                        for
                        patching holes in
                        your tent, wearing over your shoes in a "I can't believe my wellies are in the car"
                        emergency
                        and
                        for waterproofing your
                        belongings if the weather turns....well, Irish!</li>
                    <li><i class="fas fa-hiking"></i></li>
                    <li>If out for a day on the water - attach a cork from a bottle of wine to your keys.
                        That way, if your keys fall in, you don't have to be worried about that sinking feeling in
                        your
                        chest as you watch your car keys or motorhome keys sink too!
